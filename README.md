# Description

This repository contains notebooks from a machine learning project done with the goal to predict facial expression from images. These images come from the FER dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013). In order to run this properly, use your path to the FER2013 dataset (should contain folders 'test' and 'train') in the box where path is set to 'yourpath'.
